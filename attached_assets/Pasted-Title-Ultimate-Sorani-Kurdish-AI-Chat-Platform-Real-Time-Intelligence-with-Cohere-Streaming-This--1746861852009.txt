Title: Ultimate Sorani Kurdish AI Chat Platform – Real-Time Intelligence with Cohere Streaming
This project is a next-generation, full-stack AI chat system purpose-built for Sorani Kurdish users. It combines real-time response streaming, a refined right-to-left (RTL) interface, and an AI language brain that understands everything — powered by Cohere’s Command R+ model. The system is engineered for speed, depth, clarity, and cultural relevance, delivering responses that feel human, smart, and local.

🧠 What Makes It Unique
At its core is a Language Enforcement Engine and Contextual AI Understanding Layer — regardless of what language the user types (English, Arabic, Persian, Turkish, etc.), the system:

Understands the question precisely, even with mixed-language or slang input

Auto-detects the input language

Always replies in fluent, natural Sorani Kurdish

Ensures every answer reflects Kurdish culture, local context, and technical accuracy

This isn't just an AI that chats — it's an intelligent Kurdish-language assistant with global awareness and local fluency.

⚙️ Technical Stack & Architecture Overview
💬 Backend – FastAPI (Python)

Fully asynchronous backend built with FastAPI

Real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream token-by-token AI replies

Smart middleware layer to enforce Sorani output

Easily extendable for logging, auth, translations, and memory

🧠 Cohere API v2 – Command R+ (Streaming)

Connected via stream: true to Cohere’s Command R+, one of the smartest LLMs available

Delivers intelligent, context-aware, high-fidelity responses

Future-ready for RAG, search augmentation, or tool-calling integration

🧭 Language Enforcement Layer

Detects any incoming language → forces output to Sorani Kurdish

Can be extended with live translation, slang handling, and user dialect adaptation

Guarantees cultural, linguistic, and semantic consistency in all replies

⚡ Frontend – Next.js (TypeScript)

Built using Next.js App Router with full RTL layout and instant stream updates

Token-level streaming: every word appears live for a ChatGPT-like experience

Highly modular, responsive, and optimized for mobile devices

🌐 Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI

Beautifully clean UI with perfect support for Sorani fonts, typography, and direction

Pre-styled chat bubbles, input components, system messages, and animations

🔄 Redis (Optional)

Used to cache user sessions, chat history, or embeddings for fast recall

Optional integration with PostgreSQL for long-term storage or analytics

🌍 Internationalization & Sorani Default Output

UI and all model responses are defaulted to Sorani

Future support for switching frontend language, but backend will always reply in Sorani unless overridden

📲 Ultra-Responsive UX
