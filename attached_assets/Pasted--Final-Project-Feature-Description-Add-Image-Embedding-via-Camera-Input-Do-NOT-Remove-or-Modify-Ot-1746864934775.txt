 Final Project Feature Description
Add Image Embedding via Camera Input — Do NOT Remove or Modify Other Code

🎯 Objective:
Extend the current AI project by adding a new feature that lets the user capture or upload an image, send it to Cohere's /v2/embed API (input_type: "image"), and receive a real-time embedding vector.
This feature must be added without deleting or affecting any part of the existing project.

✅ Requirements:
Allow the user to capture an image from the camera (or upload from device).

Convert the image to base64 with MIME type prefix:

bash
Copy
Edit
data:image/jpeg;base64,...
Send the image to Cohere’s API:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST https://api.cohere.com/v2/embed
Receive and use the returned vector (float[]) for display, analysis, or further AI logic.

No database should be used or touched — all data is processed in memory.

All other features in the project must remain untouched and continue working normally.

🧠 Sample Code (Python for Reference / Testing)
python
Copy
Edit
import cohere
import requests
import base64

co = cohere.ClientV2("<YOUR_API_KEY>")

image = requests.get("https://cohere.com/favicon-32x32.png")
stringified_buffer = base64.b64encode(image.content).decode("utf-8")
content_type = image.headers["Content-Type"]
image_base64 = f"data:{content_type};base64,{stringified_buffer}"

response = co.embed(
    model="embed-v4.0",
    input_type="image",
    embedding_types=["float"],
    images=[image_base64],
)

print(response)
🟢 This code fetches an image, encodes it, sends it to Cohere, and prints the resulting embedding vector.

🧠 Sample Code (TypeScript for Integration)
ts
Copy
Edit
import { CohereClient } from 'cohere-ai';

const cohere = new CohereClient({
  token: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
});

(async () => {
  const embed = await cohere.v2.embed({
    texts: ['hello', 'goodbye'],
    model: 'embed-v4.0',
    inputType: 'classification',
    embeddingTypes: ['float'],
  });
  console.log(embed);
})();
🟢 This example shows how text embedding works using embed-v4.0. For images, replace texts with images and set inputType to "image".

🔧 Expected Implementation:
Component	Task
Camera / Upload UI	Capture or upload image from user
Base64 Conversion	Convert image to base64 string with MIME prefix
API Request	Send base64 image to Cohere /v2/embed with input_type: image
Embedding Display	Show or process the returned float vector immediately
Isolation	This feature must be standalone — don’t break existing functionality

❌ DO NOT:
❌ Remove or change any existing code in the project.

❌ Add a database or data storage.

❌ Replace the current AI logic — this is an addition.
